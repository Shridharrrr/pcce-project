# Authentication Fix for ThinkBuddy AI Assistant

## Issue: Invalid authentication credentials

This error occurs when you're not logged in or the authentication token is missing.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Token Validation** - Checks if user is logged in before API calls
2. **Visual Indicators** - Warning banner when not authenticated
3. **Disabled Controls** - Input and buttons disabled until login
4. **Better Error Messages** - Shows actual error details

## How to Use

### Step 1: Log In
You must be logged in to use the AI assistant.

### Step 2: Verify Token
Open browser console and check:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('token')
```
Should return a JWT token, not null.

### Step 3: Start Chatting
Once logged in, the warning banner disappears and you can chat.

## Troubleshooting

### Still showing login warning after logging in?
- Refresh the page
- Check if token is in localStorage
- Verify token format (should have 3 parts separated by dots)

### Token exists but getting auth error?
- Token might be expired
- Token format might be invalid
- Backend might not be running

## Visual Changes

- Yellow warning banner when not logged in
- Disabled input with message: "Please log in to use the assistant..."
- All predefined prompts disabled
- Send button disabled
